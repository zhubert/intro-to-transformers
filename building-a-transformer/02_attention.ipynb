    "If there's one idea that makes transformers work, it's attention. This is the mechanism that lets each token \"look at\" other tokens and gather relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the sentence: \"The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What does \"it\" refer to? A human instantly knows it's \"the animal\" (not \"the street\"... streets don't get tired). But how would a model figure this out?\n",
    "\n",
    "With attention. When processing \"it\", the model can attend to all previous words, compute which ones are relevant (high attention to \"animal\", low attention to \"street\"), and pull in that information. The representation of \"it\" becomes enriched with information about what it refers to.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core innovation: **dynamic, content-based information routing**. Unlike fixed connections in a traditional neural network, attention lets the model decide, based on the actual content, where to look."
