# The Journey Continues

When I started writing this, I thought I'd explain transformers. Maybe build a few models. Call it a day.

That's not what happened.

Every section led to another question. How do we make it follow instructions? How do we make it *think*? Can it generate images too? Each answer opened three more doors. (That's how learning works, I suppose.)

So here's where we are: you understand transformers. Not the hand-wavy "attention is like looking at things" version. The real thing. You've built them, trained them, fine-tuned them, taught them to reason, and used them to turn noise into pictures.

That's not nothing.

But it's also not everything. This field moves faster than I can type, and there's more to explore:

- Multimodal architectures (because why limit ourselves to one modality?)
- Efficient inference (because not everyone has a data center)
- Agentic systems (because generation is just the beginning)
- Whatever the next paper drops that changes everything (again)

New sections will appear as I figure them out. That's the deal. I'm learning too.

If you made it this far, thanks. Seriously. Now go break something interesting.
