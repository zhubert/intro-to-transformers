Give it a prompt and response, get a number: \"this response is good\" or \"this response is bad.\"\n\nThat's an **Outcome Reward Model (ORM)**. It judges the destination, not the journey.\n\nBut for reasoning, the journey matters. A correct answer reached through flawed logic is a ticking time bomb. A **Process Reward Model (PRM)** scores each step along the way."

   "source": "## Why PRMs Matter\n\nFrom OpenAI's \"Let's Verify Step by Step\" paper:\n\n> Process supervision has several alignment advantages over outcome supervision. It directly rewards the model for following an aligned chain-of-thought, since each step in the process receives precise supervision.\n\nThree key benefits:\n\n### 1. Better Error Detection\nORMs can be fooled by wrong answers that \"look right.\" PRMs catch logical errors even when the final answer happens to be correct.\n\n### 2. More Precise Feedback\nWhen training with RL, an ORM says \"this whole response was good/bad.\" A PRM says \"this specific step was the problem.\" Dense rewards lead to faster, more stable learning.\n\n### 3. Interpretability\nYou can *see* where the model's reasoning breaks down. Useful for debugging and building trust.\n\nThe numbers: on the MATH benchmark, OpenAI's PRM achieved **78.2%** accuracy vs **72.4%** for their best ORM. A significant gap."
