They can only access the context window. But when the model writes intermediate steps, it creates its own working memory.\n\nWhen solving \"45 - 12 + 30\":\n- Without CoT: The model must compute the answer in one \"forward pass\" through its parameters\n- With CoT: The model writes \"45 - 12 = 33\", then can *read* that result when computing \"33 + 30 = 63\"\n\n### 2. Problem Decomposition\n\nComplex problems become manageable when broken into steps. Each step is a simple subproblem the model can handle.\n\n### 3. Error Correction\n\nWhen the model writes out its reasoning, it has opportunities to notice and correct mistakes. (\"Wait, that doesn't seem right...\")\n\n### 4. Relevant Knowledge Retrieval\n\nThe intermediate steps help \"prime\" the model's attention to retrieve relevant information from its parameters.

    "Once the model writes something, it keeps going. It rarely says \"wait, let me reconsider\" and tries a different approach.\n",
