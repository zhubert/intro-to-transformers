    "### 1. Reasoning Can Be Wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "The model might generate a very confident-looking chain that's completely incorrect:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Q: What's 17 × 24?\n",
    "A: Let me work through this.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain looks reasonable, but has an error that propagates to the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Single Path\n",
    "\n",
    "With basic CoT, we sample *one* reasoning chain. What if that particular chain happens to be wrong? We're stuck with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. No Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model writes something, it keeps going. It rarely says \"wait, let me reconsider\" and tries a different approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. No Verification\n",

    "There's no mechanism to *check* if the reasoning is correct. The model just generates and hopes for the best.\n",
