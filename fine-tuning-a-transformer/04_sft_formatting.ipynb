   "source": "## Why Formatting Matters (Really Matters)\n\nHere's the thing about language models: they're just predicting the next token. That's it.\n\nThink about what happens when you type \"The capital of France is\" — the model sees those tokens and thinks \"ah yes, I've seen this pattern before in my training data, the next token is probably 'Paris'.\"\n\nBut now imagine you want the model to follow an instruction. You type:\n\n```\nTell me about Paris.\n```\n\nAnd... the model might continue with anything. Maybe it starts generating a conversation. Maybe it writes a story. Maybe it keeps asking more questions. Why? Because during pre-training, it saw all sorts of text on the internet — conversations, stories, articles, Q&A forums — and it has no idea which pattern you want it to follow right now.\n\n**This is where formatting comes in.**\n\nWhen we fine-tune a model on instructions, we're teaching it a very specific pattern:\n- When you see text formatted THIS way → that's an instruction\n- When you see THIS special marker → start your response\n- When you see THAT special token → stop generating\n\nIt's like training a dog with consistent commands. You can't say \"sit\" one day and \"please lower your rear end to the ground\" the next and expect the dog to understand. Same with models — they need consistency.\n\nWithout proper formatting:\n- The model doesn't know when to stop generating (it just keeps going...)\n- It can't tell instructions from responses (is this part of the question or the answer?)\n- Multi-turn conversations become impossible (who's talking right now?)\n- The model might repeat your instruction back to you instead of answering it\n\n**Chat templates** solve all of this by wrapping messages in a consistent structure with special tokens. And once a model learns a template, it works beautifully. But only if you use the exact same format every time.\n\n(This is why you can't just grab a model fine-tuned with one chat template and use it with a different one — it's like speaking German to someone who only learned French.)"

   "source": "## The Big Three Chat Formats\n\nDifferent research labs invented different formats. None is objectively \"better\" — they're just different conventions. Let's look at the three most popular ones.\n\n### Alpaca Format (Stanford)\n\nStanford's Alpaca team wanted something human-readable. Look at this:\n\n```\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n{instruction}\n\n### Response:\n{response}\n```\n\nSee what they did? The `### Instruction:` and `### Response:` markers are clear delimiters. A human can read this and immediately understand what's what. The model learns to recognize these markers and knows \"aha, after I see `### Response:`, I should start generating my answer.\"\n\nThere's also a variant with an `### Input:` field for tasks where you need both an instruction AND some data to work with (like \"Summarize this text: [long article]\").\n\n### ChatML Format (OpenAI)\n\nOpenAI went a different direction — special tokens that won't appear in normal text:\n\n```\n<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n{instruction}<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n{response}<|im_end|>\n```\n\nThe `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>` tokens (im = \"instant message\") are added to the tokenizer vocabulary. They're designed to never appear in regular text, which means the model can be absolutely certain that when it sees `<|im_start|>assistant`, it's time to generate a response.\n\nNotice the `system`, `user`, and `assistant` roles? This lets you:\n- Set a system prompt that guides behavior\n- Track who said what in multi-turn conversations\n- Handle back-and-forth dialogue naturally\n\n### Llama 2 Format (Meta)\n\nMeta created their own format for Llama 2:\n\n```\n<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a helpful assistant.\n<</SYS>>\n\n{instruction} [/INST] {response} </s>\n```\n\nHere:\n- `<s>` = beginning of sequence (special token)\n- `[INST]` and `[/INST]` = instruction boundaries\n- `<<SYS>>` and `<</SYS>>` = system message boundaries\n- `</s>` = end of sequence (special token)\n\nThe `<s>` and `</s>` tokens are borrowed from sequence-to-sequence models (think translation). They tell the model \"this is the start\" and \"this is the end.\"\n\n**The key insight:** All three formats do the same job — they create clear boundaries. The model just needs to learn whichever pattern you pick. But once you pick one, you're committed to it."

   "source": "## Best Practices (Learn from Others' Mistakes)\n\nHere are the things that trip people up when formatting instruction data:\n\n### 1. Be Consistent (No Really, Be Obsessively Consistent)\n\nUse the exact same format for every single training example. Not \"mostly the same\" — exactly the same. If you have:\n- 10,000 examples in Alpaca format\n- 5 examples where you forgot the preamble\n- 3 examples where you used a different marker\n\nYour model will be confused on those 8 examples and might learn the wrong pattern.\n\n### 2. Match Training and Inference\n\nThis is the #1 mistake people make. They:\n- Train with Alpaca format\n- Then try to use it with ChatML format at inference time\n- Wonder why the model outputs gibberish\n\nThe model learned that responses come after `### Response:`. If you don't include that marker when generating, it's like asking someone to \"fetch\" when you trained them to respond to \"sit\".\n\n### 3. Add Special Tokens to the Tokenizer\n\nIf you're using special tokens like `<|im_start|>` or `<s>`, you need to:\n- Add them to the tokenizer's vocabulary\n- Tell the tokenizer they're special (so they don't get split up)\n- Make sure they're present in all examples\n\n### 4. Handle Edge Cases\n\nThink about:\n- Empty inputs (what if someone sends just the instruction?)\n- Very long texts (what if the instruction+response exceeds context length?)\n- Special characters (what if the instruction contains your marker string?)\n- Unicode and emojis (does your tokenizer handle them?)\n\n### 5. Document Your Format\n\nSeriously. Write down:\n- Which chat template you used\n- Why you chose it\n- How to use the model at inference time\n- Any special tokens you added\n\nFuture you (or someone else using your model) will thank you."

   "source": "## What We Learned\n\nLet's recap what we covered:\n\n**Why formatting matters:** Language models are next-token predictors. Without consistent formatting, they don't know when to stop, when to respond, or how to handle multi-turn conversations. Chat templates solve this by creating clear boundaries with special tokens.\n\n**The three main formats:**\n- **Alpaca:** Human-readable with `### Instruction:` and `### Response:` markers\n- **ChatML:** Special tokens with role-based messages (system, user, assistant)\n- **Llama 2:** Meta's format with `[INST]` and `</s>` tokens\n\n**Built-in templates:** Modern tokenizers have chat templates baked in, so you usually don't need to write formatting code yourself. Just call `tokenizer.apply_chat_template()`.\n\n**Loss masking:** During training, we only compute loss on response tokens, not instruction tokens. This means we need to find where the response starts and mask everything before it.\n\n**Consistency is key:** Pick a format and stick with it. Use the same template during training and inference. Otherwise, your model won't understand what you're asking it to do.\n\n## Up Next\n\nNow that we understand formatting, the next notebook will dive into **loss masking** — how to actually implement the selective loss computation during training. We'll see how to create attention masks, why we mask the instruction part, and how this affects what the model learns.\n\n(Spoiler: it makes a huge difference in model quality.)"
