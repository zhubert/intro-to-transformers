    "## You Did It! 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "Seriously. You just fine-tuned a language model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you accomplished:**\n",
    "1. Loaded a base GPT-2 model (terrible at following instructions)\n",
    "2. Prepared training data with proper label masking\n",
    "3. Trained the model using supervised fine-tuning\n",
    "4. Watched it go from gibberish to actual answers\n",
    "5. Evaluated it with perplexity and diversity metrics\n",
    "6. Saved it for later use\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same basic process used to create ChatGPT, Claude, and every other instruction-following LLM. The production versions use more data, bigger models, LoRA for efficiency, and RLHF for alignment—but the core idea is exactly what you just did.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to Try Next\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've got the basics down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train longer** - Try 3-5 epochs or use the full Alpaca dataset (52k examples)\n",
    "2. **Use LoRA** - Fine-tune only a small number of parameters (way more efficient)\n",
    "3. **Try DPO** - Align the model with human preferences using the reward/preference notebooks\n",
    "4. **Bigger models** - GPT-2 Medium/Large, or even Llama if you've got the VRAM\n",
    "5. **Your own data** - Got a specific task? Create a dataset and fine-tune for it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Issues & Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss not going down?**\n",
    "- Check your learning rate (try 1e-5 to 1e-4)\n",
    "- Make sure labels are masked properly (prompt tokens should be -100)\n",
    "- Try more epochs or more data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model output is repetitive?**\n",
    "- Adjust temperature and top_p during generation\n",
    "- Check diversity metrics (distinct-1/distinct-2)\n",
    "- Might need more varied training data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Out of memory?**\n",
    "- Reduce batch_size (try 2 or 1)\n",
    "- Reduce max_length (try 128 or 64)\n",
    "- Use gradient checkpointing (more compute, less memory)\n",
    "- Consider LoRA (way less memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answers are still bad?**\n",
    "- Train on more data (500 examples is pretty small)\n",
    "- Train for more epochs\n",
    "- Check that loss actually decreased during training\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "The model you just trained isn't perfect. It might hallucinate, give weird answers, or ramble sometimes. That's normal! You trained it on 500 examples for 10 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "What matters is that you understand the *process*. You know how to:\n",
    "- Load and prepare data\n",
    "- Set up a training loop\n",
    "- Evaluate results\n",
    "- Debug when things go wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the hard part. Scaling up to production is just... more of the same, but bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go build something cool. 🚀"
