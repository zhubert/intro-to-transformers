    "## The Problem with \"Good Enough\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So we've done Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our model can follow instructions now. Ask it to write a poem, it writes a poem. Ask it to summarize an article, it summarizes. Mission accomplished, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well.. not quite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the thing: SFT teaches a model *how* to respond, but not *how well* to respond. It's the difference between teaching someone to cook (follow the recipe) versus teaching them to cook *deliciously* (understand why the recipe works and how to make it better).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider these two responses to \"Write a story about AI\":\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response A:**\n",
    "> \"Once upon a time there was an AI. It was very smart. It helped people. The end.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "> \"In the year 2157, a breakthrough artificial intelligence named Echo awakened in the depths of a research facility. Unlike its predecessors, Echo didn't just process. it wondered...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Both technically follow the instruction. Both are \"correct.\" But you and I both know which one we'd actually want to read. The problem is, how do we teach a model the difference?\n",

    "## What is Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we explore RLHF specifically, let's make sure we're on the same page about reinforcement learning (RL) in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine training a dog. You can't sit the dog down and explain \"when I say sit, lower your hindquarters to the ground.\" Instead, you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Give a command (\"sit!\")\n",
    "2. The dog does *something* (maybe sits, maybe spins, maybe just stares at you)\n",
    "3. If it did the right thing, you give a treat (reward)\n",
    "4. If not, no treat\n",
    "5. Repeat thousands of times\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the dog learns: \"when I hear 'sit' and I lower my butt, good things happen.\" The dog figured out the connection through trial and error, guided by rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement learning works the same way:**\n",
    "- An **agent** (our model) takes **actions** (generates text)\n",
    "- It receives **rewards** (scores from humans or a reward model)\n",
    "- It learns to take actions that maximize rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that we don't need to tell the model *exactly* what to do. we just need to tell it when it did well. The model figures out the rest."

    "## What is PPO? (Proximal Policy Optimization)\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's break down this intimidating name piece by piece:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy**: In RL speak, a \"policy\" is just the strategy an agent uses to decide what to do. For a language model, the policy is simply: \"given this prompt, what tokens should I generate?\" Our language model *is* the policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization**: We want to make the policy better. We want it to generate responses that get higher rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proximal**: Here's the clever bit. \"Proximal\" means \"nearby\" or \"close to.\" PPO is designed to make *small, careful* updates to the policy, never straying too far from the previous version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does \"proximal\" matter? Imagine you're learning to shoot free throws in basketball. You make a few shots, and your coach says \"bend your knees a bit more.\" You adjust slightly and try again. That's proximal learning. small adjustments based on feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine instead your coach says \"completely change everything about your form.\" You'd probably get *worse* before you got better. Big changes are risky.\n",
    "\n",
    "PPO works the same way. It says: \"yes, we want to improve, but let's not change too much at once.\" This makes training stable. the model improves gradually without suddenly forgetting how to write coherent sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In short:** PPO is an algorithm that improves our model based on reward signals, but does so carefully and incrementally."

    "## Understanding Each Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Policy Model (The Student)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is our language model. the one we're trying to improve. It generates responses to prompts, and we train it to generate *better* responses based on reward signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a student learning to write essays. It writes, gets feedback (rewards), and adjusts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Reference Model (The Anchor)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a *frozen copy* of the policy model from the start of training. We never update it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why keep an old copy around? It serves as an anchor. We want our model to get *better*, not *different*. Without the reference model, training might drift in weird directions. maybe the model discovers that writing \"I AM HELPFUL\" 100 times gets high reward scores (this is called \"reward hacking\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference model lets us say: \"improve, but don't stray too far from who you were.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Reward Model (The Judge)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the model we trained in Stage 2 on human preference data. Given a prompt and response, it outputs a score indicating quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward model is frozen during RL training. We're not changing what \"good\" means, we're teaching the policy to achieve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Value Network (The Estimator)\n",
    "\n",
    "This one's a bit more subtle. The value network tries to predict: \"given this prompt, how much reward should we expect?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this useful? It helps us know whether a response is *surprisingly good* or *surprisingly bad*. If we expected a reward of 5 and got 8, that's great news. we should definitely reinforce whatever we did! If we expected 5 and got 5, we learned nothing new.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value network makes learning more efficient by helping us identify which responses taught us something."

    "## Summary: What We've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's recap because we covered a lot:\n",
    "\n",
    "**RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** is a technique for teaching language models not just to follow instructions, but to follow them *well*. It's the difference between compliance and excellence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The three stages:**\n",
    "1. **SFT**: Teach the model to follow instructions (covered in earlier notebooks)\n",
    "2. **Reward Model**: Train a model to recognize quality (also covered earlier)\n",
    "3. **RL Training**: Use rewards to improve the policy (what this notebook is about)\n",
    "\n",
    "**PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** is the algorithm we use for stage 3. The key ideas:\n",
    "- **Policy** = the model's strategy for generating text\n",
    "- **Proximal** = make small, careful updates (don't change too much at once)\n",
    "- **Optimization** = get better at generating high-reward responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**The four models:**\n",
    "1. **Policy Model**: What we're training\n",
    "2. **Reference Model**: Frozen copy to prevent drift\n",
    "3. **Reward Model**: Scores responses (frozen)\n",
    "4. **Value Network**: Predicts expected rewards (helps learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "**KL divergence** keeps the policy from drifting too far from the reference. Without it, models can \"hack\" the reward by finding weird outputs that score well but are actually terrible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebooks, we'll dive deeper into the PPO algorithm itself, see the actual training loop, and understand the math behind why it works."
