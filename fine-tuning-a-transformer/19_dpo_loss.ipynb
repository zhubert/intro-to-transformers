Well, now we're going to dig into the actual loss function that makes it work.\n\nFair warning: there's some math ahead. But don't worry — we'll break it down piece by piece until it feels obvious."

   "source": "## The DPO Loss Formula\n\nHere's the intimidating version you'll see in papers:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{DPO}} = -\\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\log \\sigma \\left( \\beta \\left( \\log \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y_w|x)}{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y_w|x)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y_l|x)}{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y_l|x)} \\right) \\right) \\right]$$\n\nOkay, what the heck does all that mean? Let's decode every symbol:\n\n- **π_θ** (pi-theta) = your policy model (the one you're training)\n- **π_ref** (pi-ref) = your reference model (the frozen starting point, usually the SFT model)\n- **y_w** (y-win) = the chosen/winning/preferred response\n- **y_l** (y-lose) = the rejected/losing/dispreferred response  \n- **x** = the prompt/input\n- **β** (beta) = temperature parameter that controls how much the policy can deviate from reference\n- **σ** (sigma) = the sigmoid function (squashes things to 0-1 range)\n- **𝔼** (that fancy E) = expected value (just means \"average over all examples\")\n\nStill with me? Good.\n\n## The Intuition\n\nHere's what this loss is actually doing:\n\nThink of it like training a judge. You show the judge two responses to the same prompt. You tell them \"humans preferred response A over response B.\" The judge's job is to learn to predict that preference.\n\nBut here's the clever bit: instead of just learning raw preferences, we're learning **how much the new model's preferences differ from the reference model's preferences**. \n\nWhy? Because we want the new model to be better than the reference, but not go completely off the rails. The reference model is like a guardrail — we can stray from it, but not too far.\n\nLet's break down the formula step by step to see how this works in practice."

When we subtract one negative from another, we get the log of their ratio. Math trick!\n\n$$\\log \\frac{A}{B} = \\log A - \\log B$$\n\nSo `logratio_w` tells us: is the policy model more or less enthusiastic about the chosen response than the reference model was?\n\n- **Positive log ratio** → Policy likes it MORE than reference did\n- **Negative log ratio** → Policy likes it LESS than reference did  \n- **Zero** → Policy and reference agree\n\nLet's see this in code:"
