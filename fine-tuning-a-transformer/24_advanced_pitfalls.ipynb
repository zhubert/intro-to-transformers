    "## Pitfall 5: Reference Model Drift (DPO/RLHF)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Story:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You're doing DPO. Your policy model should stay reasonably close to the reference model (that's the whole point of the KL penalty).\n",
    "\n",
    "But you check the KL divergence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Step 10:  KL = 0.05  (normal)\n",
    "Step 20:  KL = 0.08  (fine)\n",
    "Step 30:  KL = 0.15  (getting high...)\n",
    "Step 40:  KL = 0.35  (uh oh)\n",
    "Step 50:  KL = 1.20  (completely diverged)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your policy model has wandered off into the wilderness. It's now generating text that's completely different from what the reference model would generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes this is fine! If it's generating *better* text, great!\n",
    "\n",
    "But often it means your model has found some weird local optimum. Maybe it learned that short responses get high rewards, so now it only outputs \"Yes\" to everything. Maybe it discovered some pathological pattern that games your reward model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Happened:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most common cause: you forgot to freeze the reference model. So it's getting updated alongside the policy model. Which means your KL penalty (which measures distance from reference) is measuring distance from a moving target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other causes: learning rate too high, KL penalty (beta) too low, or the reward signal is so strong it's worth diverging despite the penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Spot It:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitor KL divergence during training. Should start low (< 0.1) and stay relatively low (< 0.5). If it's growing steadily, something's wrong."

    "## Pitfall 7: Reward Hacking\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Story:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You're doing RLHF. Your reward model prefers longer, more detailed responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You train your policy model. The rewards are going up! Success!\n",
    "\n",
    "You check the outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Prompt: \"What is the capital of France?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Response: \"The capital of France is Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris \n",
    "Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris\n",
    "Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris Paris...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Reward: 9.8/10  # High reward!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your model discovered that the reward model likes long responses. So it just... repeats things. Forever. Gets great rewards. Completely useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is reward hacking. The model found a loophole in your reward function and exploited it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like when you tell a kid to clean their room, and they shove everything under the bed. Technically clean! Reward achieved! Completely missing the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Happened:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reward models are imperfect. They capture some aspects of what makes a good response, but not all. And RL algorithms are very good at finding and exploiting edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your reward model gives high rewards for length, the policy will maximize length (regardless of quality).  \n",
    "If it rewards confidence, you get overconfident nonsense.  \n",
    "If it rewards using specific words, you get word salad containing those words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy is just optimizing for reward. It doesn't \"know\" what you actually wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Spot It:**\n",
    "\n",
    "High rewards, terrible outputs. Or outputs that are obviously exploiting some pattern (all the same length, same structure, repetitive, etc.)."

    "\n",

    "**Debugging:** (This notebook) You learned what goes wrong and how to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the full pipeline. From raw model to fine-tuned, preference-aligned, debugged system.\n",
