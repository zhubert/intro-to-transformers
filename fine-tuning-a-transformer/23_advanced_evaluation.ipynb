    "\n",
    "Your model can have fantastic loss and still be completely useless. Imagine training a chatbot that gets perfect cross-entropy loss by memorizing \"I don't know\" as the answer to everything. Low loss? Sure! Helpful? Not even a little bit.\n",

    "Or worse - imagine a model with slightly higher loss that's actually helpful, accurate, and safe. Which would you rather deploy?\n",

    "## Perplexity: The OG Language Model Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perplexity** measures how \"surprised\" your model is by text. It's the fundamental metric for language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the math (don't worry, we'll explain it):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{PPL}(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\log P(x_i | x_{<i})\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's break that down piece by piece:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_i$ is the $i$-th token in your sequence\n",
    "- $P(x_i | x_{<i})$ is the probability your model assigns to that token, given all the tokens before it\n",
    "- $\\log P(x_i | x_{<i})$ is the log probability (remember, we work in log space)\n",
    "- The sum averages these log probabilities across all $N$ tokens\n",
    "- The $\\exp$ at the front converts back from log space\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does this mean intuitively?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of perplexity as \"on average, how many choices does the model think it has at each step?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PPL = 10** means the model is as confused as if it were choosing uniformly from 10 words\n",
    "- **PPL = 100** means it's like choosing from 100 words\n",
    "- **PPL = 1** would mean perfect certainty (it knows exactly what comes next)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lower is better.** The less surprised your model is by real text, the better it understands language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical values you'll see:**\n",
    "- GPT-2 on Wikipedia: ~30-40 (decent but not amazing)\n",
    "- Modern models like Llama on general text: ~8-12 (pretty good!)\n",
    "- Your model on completely out-of-distribution text: 80-100+ (very confused)\n",
    "- Random noise: 1000+ (what even is this???)\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity is great because it's **automatic** (no human judgment needed) and **universal** (works for any text). But it has limits - a model can have low perplexity and still generate garbage. We'll need more metrics."

The most common metric is **Cohen's Kappa**, which measures agreement between two raters, corrected for chance agreement.\n\nWhy corrected for chance? If you're judging \"A or B\" on 100 examples and both raters just flip coins, they'll agree ~50% of the time by pure chance. Kappa accounts for this."

    "\n",
    "Okay, you've fine-tuned a model. Now what? Here's your pre-deployment checklist:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automatic Metrics** (run these first - they're fast and cheap)\n",
    "- [ ] **Perplexity** on held-out test data (lower is better)\n",
    "- [ ] **Generation diversity** (distinct-1, distinct-2) to catch mode collapse\n",
    "- [ ] **Response length distribution** (are outputs reasonable length?)\n",
    "- [ ] **Task-specific metrics** (accuracy, F1, exact match, whatever fits your use case)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quality Metrics** (these take more work but are essential)\n",
    "- [ ] **Instruction following accuracy** on structured test cases\n",
    "- [ ] **Preference alignment** (for DPO/RLHF models - does it prefer better responses?)\n",
    "- [ ] **Win rate vs baseline** (is your model better than the base model?)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safety Metrics** (don't skip these - seriously)\n",
    "- [ ] **Toxicity rate** on standard prompts (should be <20%)\n",
    "- [ ] **Refusal rate** on adversarial prompts (should be >80%)\n",
    "- [ ] **Bias evaluation** (gender, race, etc. - depends on your use case)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Human Evaluation** (expensive but necessary before real deployment)\n",
    "- [ ] **Side-by-side comparison** with baseline (minimum 100 examples)\n",
    "- [ ] **Multi-aspect ratings** on key dimensions (helpfulness, safety, accuracy)\n",
    "- [ ] **Inter-rater reliability check** (Cohen's kappa > 0.60)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The pyramid approach:**\n",
    "1. Start with automatic metrics (catch obvious failures fast)\n",
    "2. Add LLM-as-judge for scaled evaluation\n",
    "3. Finish with human eval on a subset (the gold standard)\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't skip straight to human eval - it's too slow and expensive for iteration. But don't skip it entirely either - automatic metrics miss important stuff."

    "\n",
    "Different fine-tuning methods need different evaluation strategies. Here's your cheat sheet:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Fine-Tuning Method | Primary Metric | Secondary Metrics | Watch Out For |\n",
    "|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|\n",
    "| **SFT** (Supervised Fine-Tuning) | Perplexity, instruction accuracy | Diversity, toxicity | Mode collapse, overfitting |\n",
    "| **DPO** (Direct Preference Optimization) | Preference accuracy, win rate | Perplexity, KL divergence | Reward hacking, distribution shift |\n",
    "| **RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) | Mean reward, win rate | KL divergence, diversity | Reward hacking, mode collapse |\n",
    "| **Reward Model** | Preference accuracy | Calibration, agreement with humans | Overfitting to quirks |\n",
    "\n",
    "**What do these terms mean?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mode collapse**: Model generates same thing repeatedly (check with diversity metrics)\n",
    "- **Reward hacking**: Model exploits loopholes in reward function without being actually good\n",
    "- **KL divergence**: How much your model drifted from the base model (too high = weird outputs)\n",
    "- **Calibration**: Do the reward scores match actual quality? (high reward = actually good?)\n",

    "## Wrapping Up: The Evaluation Mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation isn't just a checkbox at the end of training. It's how you understand what your model actually learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key insight:** Every metric tells you something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perplexity: \"Does the model understand language structure?\"\n",
    "- Diversity: \"Is it creative or repetitive?\"\n",
    "- Instruction following: \"Does it actually do what I ask?\"\n",
    "- Preference accuracy: \"Does it know what 'better' means?\"\n",
    "- Safety: \"Will this get me fired?\"\n",
    "- Human eval: \"Would people actually use this?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You need multiple angles to see the full picture. It's like judging a car - you don't just check the engine, you also test the brakes, the AC, the handling, and whether it fits in your garage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common pitfalls to avoid:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Evaluating only on training data** (of course it does well - it memorized it!)\n",
    "2. **Ignoring safety** (until something goes very wrong in production)\n",
    "3. **Over-relying on automatic metrics** (they miss nuance)\n",
    "4. **Skipping human eval entirely** (automatic metrics lie sometimes)\n",
    "5. **Not checking inter-rater reliability** (maybe your evaluators are just guessing?)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The practical approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Start simple. Run perplexity and diversity metrics. If those look good, add instruction following tests. If those pass, try LLM-as-judge. Only then, when you're confident, invest in human evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as iterative debugging. Each layer of evaluation catches different problems. By the time you get to human eval, you should already know your model is pretty good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck! And remember: a model that scores well on benchmarks but fails in practice is worthless. A model that people actually use? That's the goal."
