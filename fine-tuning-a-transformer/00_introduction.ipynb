   "source": "## What is Post-Training, Really?\n\nImagine you've trained a fancy autocomplete machine to predict what word comes next in any sentence. You feed it the entire internet, and now it can complete any text you throw at it. Impressive!\n\nBut here's the thing: it doesn't know it's supposed to *help* you. Ask it \"What's the capital of France?\" and it might just continue with \"What's the capital of Germany? What's the capital of Italy?\" Because that's what text on the internet looks like — lists of similar questions.\n\nThis is the problem with **pre-trained models**. They're brilliant at language, but they don't know they're supposed to be assistants.\n\n**Post-training** (also called fine-tuning or alignment) is how we fix this. It's the process of teaching a pre-trained language model to:\n\n- **Follow instructions** — When you ask a question, it should answer (not just complete your sentence)\n- **Align with human preferences** — Generate responses humans actually like\n- **Refuse harmful requests** — Say \"no\" to dangerous or unethical tasks\n- **Be truthful** — Admit when it doesn't know something\n\nThis is what transforms a base model (fancy autocomplete) into an assistant (actually helpful).\n\nThink of it like this: pre-training teaches you grammar and vocabulary by reading every book in the library. Post-training is like going to charm school to learn *how to have a conversation*."

    "\n",
    "### Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest approach: show the model good examples and train it to imitate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You give it thousands of pairs like:\n",
    "- **Instruction:** \"What's the capital of France?\"\n",
    "- **Response:** \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And the model learns: \"Oh, when someone asks me a question, I should answer it directly.\" Simple! Effective! But limited by the quality and diversity of your examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like learning to cook by following recipes. You'll get good at the dishes you practiced, but you might struggle with variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where things get interesting (and complicated).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you train a **reward model** to predict which responses humans prefer. You show it pairs like:\n",
    "- **Prompt:** \"Explain quantum computing\"\n",
    "- **Response A:** \"Quantum computers use qubits...\" ✓ (humans prefer this)\n",
    "- **Response B:** \"Idk lol\" ✗ (humans reject this)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you use **PPO** (Proximal Policy Optimization — a reinforcement learning algorithm) to train your language model to generate responses that score highly on the reward model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like learning to cook by having a food critic taste everything and give you feedback. You experiment, get scored, and gradually learn what people like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside? This is *complicated*. You need two models (language model + reward model), and PPO is notoriously finicky to tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "DPO is the new kid on the block, and it's elegant as hell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight: you can skip the reward model entirely! Instead of:\n",
    "1. Train reward model on preferences\n",
    "2. Use RL to optimize language model against reward model\n",
    "\n",
    "You just:\n",
    "1. Directly optimize the language model on preference pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "It reformulates the whole RLHF pipeline as a simple classification loss. Same results, way simpler, more stable training.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like learning to cook by comparing your dishes to reference examples: \"My version should taste more like the good example and less like the bad example.\" No critic needed — you learn directly from the comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "(We'll implement all three methods, so you can see the tradeoffs yourself.)"
