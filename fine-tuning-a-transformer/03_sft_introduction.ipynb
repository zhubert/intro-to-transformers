    "## What is Supervised Fine-Tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**SFT** stands for **Supervised Fine-Tuning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does \"supervised\" mean here? Same thing it means in \"supervised learning\". we're showing the model examples of correct input-output pairs. Think of it like teaching with flashcards: \"When someone asks this question, give this answer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight: if you want a model to answer questions well, show it examples of good question-answer pairs. If you want it to write code, show it examples of good code solutions. The model learns by example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the math:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SFT}} = -\\sum_{t} \\log P(y_t | x, y_{<t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x$ is your **instruction** or **prompt**: like \"What's the capital of France?\"\n",
    "- $y$ is the complete **response**: like \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n",
    "- $y_t$ is the **token at position t** in the response. maybe \"Paris\" is token 7\n",
    "- $y_{<t}$ means **all the tokens before position t**: everything up to but not including \"Paris\"\n",
    "- $P(y_t | x, y_{<t})$ is the **probability** the model assigns to the correct token, given the instruction and all previous response tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "We're summing up (that $\\sum$ symbol) the log probabilities across all tokens in the response. The negative sign is there because we want to *maximize* probability, which is the same as *minimizing* negative log probability. (Loss functions are things we minimize, by convention.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain English: we're teaching the model to predict each word in the response, one at a time, given the instruction and the words it's already generated."

    "## SFT vs Pre-Training: What's the Difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be thinking: \"Wait, isn't this just more training? What makes SFT different from pre-training?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Pre-Training | Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-----|\n",
    "| **Data** | Raw text from everywhere (books, websites, Wikipedia) | Carefully curated (instruction, response) pairs |\n",
    "| **Objective** | Predict the next token in *any* text | Generate helpful responses to instructions |\n",
    "| **Scale** | Trillions of tokens | Thousands to millions of examples |\n",
    "| **Duration** | Weeks to months on huge GPU clusters | Hours to days on a single GPU |\n",
    "| **Learning rate** | Higher (around 1e-4). The model is learning from scratch | Lower (1e-5 to 3e-4). we're tweaking, not rebuilding |\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference? **Pre-training teaches the model language.** What words go together, grammar, facts about the world. It's like teaching someone to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SFT teaches the model how to behave.** How to respond when asked a question, how to format code, when to be concise vs detailed. It's like teaching someone to be a good conversationalist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-training is *expensive*. SFT is *cheap* (relatively speaking). That's why you pre-train once and fine-tune many times for different use cases."

Here are three famous datasets that kicked off the open-source instruction-following movement:\n\n### Alpaca (Stanford, 2023)\n- **Size:** 52,000 instructions\n- **Source:** Generated by GPT-3.5 based on 175 seed examples\n- **Format:** Instruction + optional input → output\n- **Vibe:** Diverse tasks, but sometimes a bit...formulaic (it's AI-generated, after all)\n\nStanford trained a LLaMA model on this dataset for less than $600. That's when everyone realized you could create capable instruction-following models on a budget.\n\n### Dolly (Databricks, 2023)\n- **Size:** 15,000 instructions\n- **Source:** Written by actual humans (Databricks employees!)\n- **Quality:** Higher quality than Alpaca, more natural\n- **Limitation:** Smaller, less diverse\n\n### OpenAssistant (LAION, 2023)\n- **Size:** 161,000 messages in conversation trees\n- **Source:** Community-contributed through a web interface\n- **Format:** Multi-turn conversations with human rankings\n- **Cool feature:** Includes quality ratings, so you can filter for the good stuff\n\nWe'll use Alpaca in our examples because it's clean, well-formatted, and perfect for learning."

    "\n",
    "**2. Format your instruction data**  \n",

    "\n",
    "**3. Tokenize everything**  \n",
    "Turn text into numbers (token IDs). Both the instruction and the response get tokenized together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Apply loss masking**  \n",
    "Here's the key trick: we only compute loss on the *response* tokens, not the instruction tokens. Why? Because we don't want the model to learn to predict the instruction. We want it to learn to predict good *responses* to instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Train with cross-entropy loss**  \n",
    "Standard supervised learning. Show the model an instruction, ask it to predict the response token by token, update weights based on how well it did.\n",

    "**6. Save your fine-tuned model**  \n",
