    "## The Traditional Pipeline (And Why It's Complicated)\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic RLHF approach goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start with a base language model\n",
    "2. Train a reward model on preference data (that's what we just did!)\n",
    "3. Use that reward model to score responses\n",
    "4. Use reinforcement learning (PPO) to optimize the language model\n",
    "5. Deal with all the instability and complexity that PPO brings\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It works. Companies use it. But it's a pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're juggling multiple models, dealing with RL instability, tuning a bunch of hyperparameters, and basically hoping everything converges nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The DPO Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the key realization that led to DPO:\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you know the optimal policy (the perfect language model), you can derive what the optimal reward function must be.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Read that again. It's wild.\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually think: reward function → optimal policy. But it also works backward: optimal policy → reward function.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of:\n",
    "1. Train reward model\n",
    "2. Use reward model to train policy\n",
    "\n",
    "We do:\n",
    "1. Train policy directly to match what the optimal policy would be\n",
    "\n",
    "No reward model. No RL. Just a clean loss function that optimizes your language model directly on preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like... instead of learning how to judge food quality and then using those judgments to become a better chef, you just study what makes great food great and cook accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does it work? Hell yes. In many cases, it works *better* than RLHF."

    "## Understanding the Key Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about the knobs you can turn and what they actually do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### β (Beta) - The KL Penalty Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default: 0.1**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most important hyperparameter in DPO.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a leash. Higher β = shorter leash. The policy can't stray as far from the reference model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Too high (β = 1.0)**: Policy barely changes, stuck close to reference\n",
    "- **Too low (β = 0.01)**: Policy might overfit to preferences, forget general knowledge\n",
    "- **Just right (β = 0.1-0.5)**: Sweet spot for most tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you know if β is right? If your model starts generating nonsense or forgetting basic facts, β is probably too low.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default: 1e-6**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tiny. Like, really tiny.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to RLHF - we're making small, careful updates. Language models are sensitive, and DPO is pushing them in a specific direction. Go too fast and you'll overshoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with 1e-6. If training is too slow (loss barely moving), try 5e-6. If it's unstable (loss jumping around), try 5e-7.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of Epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default: 1-3**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the thing about preference data: you can overfit *fast*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike pretraining where more data is always better, with DPO you're teaching specific preferences. Too many epochs and the model memorizes the training set instead of learning general principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "One epoch is often enough. Three is usually the max. If you need more, you probably need more diverse data, not more epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch Size\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default: 4-32**\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deep learning advice applies: bigger batches = more stable gradients = faster training.\n",
    "\n",
    "But: bigger batches = more memory. If you're GPU-limited, use smaller batches and accumulate gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual batch size matters less than getting enough total training steps."

    "## What We Just Built\n",

    "- Training a separate reward model\n",
    "- Running reinforcement learning\n",
    "- Dealing with PPO's complexity and instability\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we:\n",
    "1. Kept a frozen copy of the starting model (reference)\n",
    "2. Trained a new copy (policy) to prefer chosen over rejected responses\n",
    "3. Used β to prevent the policy from drifting too far\n",
    "\n",
    "The math is elegant. The implementation is straightforward. The results are competitive with (and sometimes better than) full RLHF.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why DPO has become so popular. It democratizes alignment - you don't need an RL expert on your team to make it work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use DPO\n",
    "\n",
    "DPO shines when:\n",
    "- You have good preference data\n",
    "- You want alignment without RL complexity  \n",
    "- You're fine-tuning a model that's already been supervised fine-tuned\n",
    "- You want something stable and predictable\n",
    "\n",
    "DPO might not be ideal when:\n",
    "- Your preference data is noisy (reward models can be more robust)\n",
    "- You need complex reward shaping\n",
    "- You want to combine multiple objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "From here you could:\n",
    "- Experiment with different β values to see how they affect the tradeoff\n",
    "- Try DPO on your own preference dataset\n",
    "- Combine DPO with LoRA for parameter-efficient training\n",
    "- Evaluate your DPO model on a held-out test set\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of DPO is that it's just supervised learning with a clever loss function. Everything you know about training neural networks still applies."
