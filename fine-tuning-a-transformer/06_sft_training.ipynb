    "Congratulations! You just trained a transformer from scratch (well, fine-tuned one, but that still counts).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Training Loop** is three steps repeated thousands of times:\n",
    "- Forward pass: Show the model data, get predictions\n",
    "- Backward pass: Calculate gradients (how wrong were we?)\n",
    "- Optimizer step: Update weights to be less wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epochs** are complete passes through the training data. More epochs = more learning, but also more risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Accumulation** lets us simulate bigger batch sizes without running out of memory. We accumulate gradients over multiple small batches, then update.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Rate Scheduling** adjusts how aggressively we update weights. Start with warmup (ease into it), then gradually decrease (make smaller adjustments as we get closer to optimal).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation Loss** tells us if we're actually learning or just memorizing. If it starts going up while training loss goes down, that's overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label Masking** (the -100 trick) means we only train on the parts we care about (the responses), not the prompts.\n",
