More epochs = more learning, but also more risk of overfitting.\n\n**Gradient Accumulation** lets us simulate bigger batch sizes without running out of memory. We accumulate gradients over multiple small batches, then update.\n\n**Learning Rate Scheduling** adjusts how aggressively we update weights. Start with warmup (ease into it), then gradually decrease (make smaller adjustments as we get closer to optimal).\n\n**Validation Loss** tells us if we're actually learning or just memorizing. If it starts going up while training loss goes down, that's overfitting.\n\n**Label Masking** (the -100 trick) means we only train on the parts we care about (the responses), not the prompts.\n\n---\n\nNext up: **LoRA** - a clever way to fine-tune with way fewer parameters."
