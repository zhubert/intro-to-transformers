    "\n",
    "If you only tune one hyperparameter, make it the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is it?** The learning rate controls how big of a step your optimizer takes when updating model weights. Think of it like this: you're hiking down a mountain in the fog (the fog is the loss landscape, stay with me). The learning rate is how big your steps are.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Too high:** You take huge steps, overshoot the valley, and bounce around like a pinball. Eventually you might bounce right off the mountain (Loss = NaN).\n",
    "- **Too low:** You take tiny, shuffling steps. You're *technically* making progress, but you'll die of old age before reaching the bottom.\n",
    "- **Just right:** Nice, confident steps that make steady progress toward the minimum.\n",

    "### Learning Rates for SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're doing supervised fine-tuning, your model is already pre-trained. The weights are already pretty good! You just need to nudge them in the right direction. Small, gentle nudges.\n",

    "| Setup | Learning Rate | Why? |\n",
    "|-------|--------------|------|\n",
    "| Full fine-tuning | 2e-5 to 5e-5 | Model already knows language, small updates preserve that knowledge |\n",
    "| LoRA (r=8-16) | 1e-4 to 5e-4 | LoRA parameters start random, need stronger updates to learn anything |\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice something? LoRA uses a *higher* learning rate than full fine-tuning. This trips people up constantly. \"Wait, I thought lower learning rates were safer?\" They are! But LoRA's low-rank matrices start from random initialization. You need a bigger learning rate to get them moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Rates for DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)\n",
    "\n",

A batch size of 8 means: look at 8 examples, compute gradients for all of them, average those gradients together, then take one optimization step.\n\n### The Effective Batch Size\n\nThe *effective* batch size is what actually matters:\n\n```\neffective_batch_size = batch_size × gradient_accumulation_steps × num_gpus\n```\n\n**Gradient accumulation** is a clever trick. If you can only fit 4 examples in memory, but you want an effective batch of 32, you can:\n1. Process 4 examples, compute gradients (but don't update weights yet)\n2. Process 4 more examples, add their gradients to the first batch\n3. Repeat 8 times total (4 × 8 = 32)\n4. *Now* update the weights\n\nSame effective batch size, fits in less memory. Neat!\n\n### Recommended Batch Sizes\n\n| Method | Effective Batch | Typical Physical Batch | Why? |\n|--------|----------------|----------------------|------|\n| SFT | 32-128 | 8-16 per GPU | Stable gradients, good throughput |\n| DPO | 16-64 | 4-8 per GPU | Each example is chosen+rejected pair (2x memory!) |\n| RLHF | 16-64 | 4-8 per GPU | RL is unstable, smaller batches help |\n| Reward Model | 32-64 | 8-16 per GPU | Comparison task, benefits from variety |\n\nNotice DPO uses smaller batches.

    "## DPO Beta: The Preference Strength Knob\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, time for the DPO-specific hyperparameter that causes the most confusion: **beta**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the DPO loss function? Here it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{DPO}} = -\\log \\sigma\\left(\\beta \\left[\\log \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y_w|x)}{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y_w|x)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y_l|x)}{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y_l|x)}\\right]\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That $\\beta$ controls how strongly you push the model to prefer the chosen response over the rejected one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does beta do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low beta (0.01-0.05):** Gentle nudges. \"Hey model, maybe prefer this response a *little* bit more?\"\n",
    "- **Medium beta (0.1-0.3):** Standard. \"I'd like you to clearly prefer the chosen response.\"\n",
    "- **High beta (0.5-1.0):** Aggressive. \"YOU WILL PREFER THIS RESPONSE OR ELSE.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher beta = stronger preference signal = more risk of overfitting to your preference data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Choose Beta\n",
    "\n",
    "The key question: **How much do you trust your preference data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Quality | Beta Range | Reasoning |\n",
    "|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n",
    "| High (human annotations, clear preferences) | 0.1-0.3 | Trust your data, use it! |\n",
    "| Medium (AI-labeled, decent quality) | 0.05-0.1 | Some noise, be gentle |\n",
    "| Low (heuristics, noisy labels) | 0.01-0.05 | Don't overfit to noise |\n",
    "\n",
    "If your preference data is \"Response A uses proper grammar and Response B is gibberish,\" you can use a higher beta. If your preference data is \"Response A is slightly better according to this AI judge that might be hallucinating,\" maybe go lower."

    "## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about the mistakes I see people make over and over again. Learn from our collective pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake #1: Using the Same Learning Rate Everywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the big one. People find a learning rate that works for SFT and then use it for everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Nooooo!\n",
    "sft_config = SFTConfig(learning_rate=3e-4)      # ✓ Good for SFT\n",
    "dpo_config = DPOConfig(learning_rate=3e-4)      # ✗ Way too high!\n",
    "rlhf_config = RLHFConfig(policy_lr=3e-4)        # ✗ Model will explode!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Yes! Method-specific learning rates\n",
    "sft_config = SFTConfig(learning_rate=3e-4)      # ✓ Standard for SFT\n",
    "dpo_config = DPOConfig(learning_rate=5e-5)      # ✓ 5-10x lower\n",
    "rlhf_config = RLHFConfig(policy_lr=1e-5)        # ✓ Even lower for RL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** DPO and RLHF are much more sensitive than SFT. A learning rate that works fine for supervised learning will send your preference model into the stratosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake #2: Not Scaling Learning Rate for LoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA uses randomly initialized matrices. They need a higher learning rate than pre-trained weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using full fine-tuning LR with LoRA\n",
    "config = SFTConfig(learning_rate=3e-5)  # ✗ Too low! LoRA will barely learn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Higher LR for LoRA's random initialization\n",
    "config = SFTConfig(learning_rate=3e-4)  # ✓ About 10x higher than full FT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** With a too-low learning rate, LoRA will technically train, but it'll take forever and might not reach good performance. You'll waste hours wondering why your model isn't learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake #3: Skipping Warmup\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting training with a high learning rate is like flooring the accelerator when your car is still in the driveway. Recipe for chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "config = SFTConfig(\n",
    "    learning_rate=3e-4,\n",
    "    warmup_steps=0,  # ✗ No warmup = unstable start\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "config = SFTConfig(\n",
    "    learning_rate=3e-4,\n",
    "    warmup_steps=100,  # ✓ 5-10% of training steps\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** At the start of training, gradients can be large and unpredictable. Warmup gives the model a chance to stabilize before taking big steps. It's especially important for LoRA, where those random matrices start with crazy gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake #4: Ignoring Effective Batch Size\n",
    "\n",
    "\"My batch size is 4\" is not complete information. The *effective* batch size is what matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Misleading:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# These look the same, but they're not!\n",
    "config_a = SFTConfig(batch_size=32, gradient_accumulation_steps=1)\n",
    "config_b = SFTConfig(batch_size=4, gradient_accumulation_steps=8)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both have effective batch size = 32, but:\n",
    "- Config A: Process 32 examples at once (high memory, one update)\n",
    "- Config B: Process 4 examples at a time, 8 accumulation steps (low memory, one update)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** If you report \"I used batch size 4\" without mentioning gradient accumulation, others can't reproduce your results. Always think in terms of effective batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake #5: Cranking Up Beta Without Good Data\n",
    "\n",
    "High beta with noisy preference data is a disaster waiting to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# AI-generated preference labels (might be noisy)\n",
    "dpo_config = DPOConfig(\n",
    "    beta=1.0,  # ✗ Too aggressive for noisy data\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# AI-generated preference labels (might be noisy)\n",
    "dpo_config = DPOConfig(\n",
    "    beta=0.05,  # ✓ Gentle, won't overfit to noise\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** Beta amplifies your preference signal. If that signal is noisy, high beta means \"strongly overfit to garbage.\" Start low, increase if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern here? Most mistakes come from copy-pasting configs without understanding what the hyperparameters actually do. Now you know better."
