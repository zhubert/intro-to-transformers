    "**What is it?** The learning rate controls how big of a step your optimizer takes when updating model weights. Think of it like this: you're hiking down a mountain in the fog (the fog is the loss landscape, stay with me). The learning rate is how big your steps are.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Too high:** You take huge steps, overshoot the valley, and bounce around like a pinball. Eventually you might bounce right off the mountain (Loss = NaN).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Learning Rates for DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)\n",
    "\n",
    "DPO is.. sensitive. Like, *really* sensitive. You're not teaching the model new tasks, you're adjusting its preferences between similar outputs. This requires a delicate touch.\n",

    "## RLHF: The KL Divergence Leash\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're doing RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback) with PPO, you have a different problem: your policy model might go completely off the rails chasing reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a reward model that gives high scores for helpful responses. Without any constraints, your policy might discover that repeating \"This is helpful! This is helpful! This is helpful!\" 500 times gets a high reward score. Technically the reward model likes it.. but it's not actually useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "(This happens. Like, a lot.)\n",

    "That $\\lambda_{\\text{KL}}$ (often called `kl_coef`) controls how tight the leash is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low KL coef (0.01):** Long leash. Policy can wander far from reference. Risky!\n",
    "- **Medium KL coef (0.1):** Standard leash. Balanced exploration and safety.\n",

    "### Mistake #1: Using the Same Learning Rate Everywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the big one. People find a learning rate that works for SFT and then use it for everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Nooooo!\n",
    "sft_config = SFTConfig(learning_rate=3e-4)      # ✓ Good for SFT\n",
    "dpo_config = DPOConfig(learning_rate=3e-4)      # ✗ Way too high!\n",
    "rlhf_config = RLHFConfig(policy_lr=3e-4)        # ✗ Model will explode!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Yes! Method-specific learning rates\n",
    "sft_config = SFTConfig(learning_rate=3e-4)      # ✓ Standard for SFT\n",
    "dpo_config = DPOConfig(learning_rate=5e-5)      # ✓ 5-10x lower\n",
    "rlhf_config = RLHFConfig(policy_lr=1e-5)        # ✓ Even lower for RL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** DPO and RLHF are much more sensitive than SFT. A learning rate that works fine for supervised learning will send your preference model into the stratosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake #2: Not Scaling Learning Rate for LoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA uses randomly initialized matrices. They need a higher learning rate than pre-trained weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using full fine-tuning LR with LoRA\n",

    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake #3: Skipping Warmup\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting training with a high learning rate is like flooring the accelerator when your car is still in the driveway. Recipe for chaos.\n",

    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** At the start of training, gradients can be large and unpredictable. Warmup gives the model a chance to stabilize before taking big steps. It's especially important for LoRA, where those random matrices start with crazy gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake #4: Ignoring Effective Batch Size\n",
    "\n",
    "\"My batch size is 4\" isn't complete information. The *effective* batch size is what matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Misleading:**\n",

    "### Mistake #5: Cranking Up Beta Without Good Data\n",
    "\n",
