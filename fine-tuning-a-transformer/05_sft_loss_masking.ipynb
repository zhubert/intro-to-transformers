    "Picture this. You're training a model on instruction-following. Your data looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[User asks a question] [Model gives a great answer]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[INSTRUCTION TOKENS] [RESPONSE TOKENS]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here's the trap. If you compute loss on _all_ the tokens (like you would during pretraining), the model learns two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to predict the instruction (bad! the user gives us that)\n",
    "2. How to predict the response (good! this is what we want)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like training a chef by making them memorize both the customer's order _and_ how to cook the dish. We only care about #2!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss masking** is the solution. We set the loss to zero for instruction tokens, so the model only learns from response tokens. The model still _sees_ the instruction (it needs that context), but it doesn't get graded on predicting it.\n",

    "- $t$ is the **time step** (or position in the sequence) — think of it like an index: token 1, token 2, token 3...\n",
    "- $T$ is the **total length** of the sequence — if we have 100 tokens, $T = 100$\n",
    "- $x_t$ is the **token at position** $t$ — this is the actual token we're trying to predict\n",
    "- $x_{<t}$ means \"all tokens _before_ position $t$\" — the context the model uses to predict $x_t$\n",
    "- $P(x_t | x_{<t})$ is the **probability** the model assigns to the correct token, given the context\n",
    "- $\\sum_{t=1}^{T}$ means \"sum over all positions from 1 to $T$\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So this formula says: \"Calculate the negative log probability for _every_ token in the sequence, then add them all up.\" The model gets penalized equally for every token it predicts wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With masking** (the smart approach):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L} = -\\sum_{t=t_{\\text{response}}}^{T} \\log P(x_t | x_{<t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Same formula, but notice the sum now starts at $t_{\\text{response}}$ instead of $t=1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $t_{\\text{response}}$ is the **position where the response begins** — everything before this is the instruction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we only sum over the response tokens! The instruction tokens (positions 1 through $t_{\\text{response}}-1$) contribute zero to the loss.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Without loss masking:**\n",
    "- **Wasted capacity**: The model dedicates parameters to predicting instruction phrasings instead of response quality. It's like hiring a chef and making them memorize the menu instead of learning to cook.\n",
    "- **Memorization risk**: The model might start memorizing specific instruction templates. \"Oh, the user always asks 'What is...' so I'll just predict that pattern.\" Not helpful.\n",
    "- **Diluted gradients**: The gradient signal (the learning signal) gets spread across _all_ tokens. If your instruction is 50 tokens and your response is 50 tokens, half your gradient is wasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With loss masking:**\n",
    "- **Focused learning**: All the model's capacity goes toward generating good responses. This is what we actually care about.\n",
    "- **Stronger signal**: The gradient signal is concentrated on the response tokens. It's like turning up the volume on the parts that matter.\n",
    "- **Better generalization**: The model doesn't overfit to specific instruction phrasings. It learns the general skill of \"given a context, generate a good response.\"\n",
