Which is...not what we want.\n\nThis notebook is about how to avoid that mistake. Short version: loss masking. Let's dig in."

   "source": "## The Problem: Teaching a Model the Wrong Thing\n\nPicture this. You're training a model on instruction-following. Your data looks like this:\n\n```\n[User asks a question] [Model gives a great answer]\n```\n\nOr in token-speak:\n\n```\n[INSTRUCTION TOKENS] [RESPONSE TOKENS]\n```\n\nNow here's the trap. If you compute loss on _all_ the tokens (like you would during pretraining), the model learns two things:\n\n1. How to predict the instruction (bad! the user gives us that)\n2. How to predict the response (good! this is what we want)\n\nIt's like training a chef by making them memorize both the customer's order _and_ how to cook the dish. We only care about #2!\n\n**Loss masking** is the solution. We set the loss to zero for instruction tokens, so the model only learns from response tokens. The model still _sees_ the instruction (it needs that context), but it doesn't get graded on predicting it.\n\nThink of it like a student taking a test where the questions are provided (not graded) and only the answers count toward their score."

   "source": "## The Math (Don't Worry, We'll Explain Each Symbol)\n\nLet's write this out formally. But instead of throwing symbols at you, we'll actually explain what each one means.\n\n**Without masking** (the naive approach):\n\n$$\\mathcal{L} = -\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\log P(x_t | x_{<t})$$\n\nBreaking this down:\n- $\\mathcal{L}$ is the **loss** — the number we're trying to minimize during training\n- $t$ is the **time step** (or position in the sequence) — think of it like an index: token 1, token 2, token 3...\n- $T$ is the **total length** of the sequence — if we have 100 tokens, $T = 100$\n- $x_t$ is the **token at position** $t$ — this is the actual token we're trying to predict\n- $x_{<t}$ means \"all tokens _before_ position $t$\" — the context the model uses to predict $x_t$\n- $P(x_t | x_{<t})$ is the **probability** the model assigns to the correct token, given the context\n- $\\sum_{t=1}^{T}$ means \"sum over all positions from 1 to $T$\"\n\nSo this formula says: \"Calculate the negative log probability for _every_ token in the sequence, then add them all up.\" The model gets penalized equally for every token it predicts wrong.\n\n**With masking** (the smart approach):\n\n$$\\mathcal{L} = -\\sum_{t=t_{\\text{response}}}^{T} \\log P(x_t | x_{<t})$$\n\nSame formula, but notice the sum now starts at $t_{\\text{response}}$ instead of $t=1$. \n\n- $t_{\\text{response}}$ is the **position where the response begins** — everything before this is the instruction\n\nNow we only sum over the response tokens! The instruction tokens (positions 1 through $t_{\\text{response}}-1$) contribute zero to the loss.\n\n(Yeah, the math is actually pretty simple once you know what the symbols mean.)"

   "source": "## Why This Actually Matters (Beyond the Obvious)\n\nOkay, so we've established that we don't want the model learning to predict instructions. But let's dig deeper into _why_ this matters:\n\n**Without loss masking:**\n- **Wasted capacity**: The model dedicates parameters to predicting instruction phrasings instead of response quality. It's like hiring a chef and making them memorize the menu instead of learning to cook.\n- **Memorization risk**: The model might start memorizing specific instruction templates. \"Oh, the user always asks 'What is...' so I'll just predict that pattern.\" Not helpful.\n- **Diluted gradients**: The gradient signal (the learning signal) gets spread across _all_ tokens. If your instruction is 50 tokens and your response is 50 tokens, half your gradient is wasted.\n\n**With loss masking:**\n- **Focused learning**: All the model's capacity goes toward generating good responses. This is what we actually care about.\n- **Stronger signal**: The gradient signal is concentrated on the response tokens. It's like turning up the volume on the parts that matter.\n- **Better generalization**: The model doesn't overfit to specific instruction phrasings. It learns the general skill of \"given a context, generate a good response.\"\n\nThe difference? Real. Measurable. The models trained with proper loss masking just work better.\n\n(This is one of those things that seems like a small implementation detail but actually has a huge impact on final model quality.)"

Simple idea, big impact.\n\nThe key insight: during supervised fine-tuning, we only want the model to learn to generate responses, not to predict the instructions we give it. Loss masking accomplishes this by zeroing out the loss for instruction tokens.\n\n**Two ways to implement it:**\n1. Manual masking: create a mask tensor (0 for instruction, 1 for response) and multiply it with your per-token loss\n2. HuggingFace convention: set instruction positions to -100 in your labels tensor\n\nBoth work. The HuggingFace approach is simpler if you're using their libraries (which you probably are).\n\n**Why it matters:**\n- Focuses the model's learning on what actually matters (response quality)\n- Prevents wasting capacity on instruction memorization  \n- Concentrates gradient signal where it's useful\n- Results in better, more generalizable models\n\nNow that we understand loss masking, we're ready to put it all together in a complete SFT training loop.
